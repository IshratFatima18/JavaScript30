  Hi there üëã

I created this repository in order to keep track of my progress in the JavaScript 30 Day Challenge and to commit and log what I have learnet every day.
  
  # What is JavaScript 30 Day Challenge ? <br>
  It's a 30-day vanilla JavaScript coding challenge. You will build 30 unique projects in 30 days using fun and easy video tutorials.

 # JavaScript 30-Day 10
 ## Hold Shift to Check Multiple Checkboxes 
 ###  ‚úçÔ∏èMy learnings from this project: 
  Code Example:
   ```const checkboxes = document.querySelectorAll('.inbox input[type="checkbox"]');```
 - Check if they had the shift key down
 - AND check that they are checking it
  ``` let inBetween = false;
      inBetween = !inBetween;
      checkboxes.forEach(checkbox => checkbox.addEventListener('click', handleCheck));
  ```
  
***‚ú¶ How it works:***
 - When you click a checkbox, hold Shift, and click another checkbox a few rows down or up, all the checkboxes in between those two are checked.
   BOOM!! Wes style :D
  
    
    
  # JavaScript 30-Day 11
  ## Custom Video Player

  # JavaScript 30-Day 13 
  ## Slide in on Scroll

  ‚ú¶ As you scroll down, images slide in from the right or left sides of the page.
  ### ‚úçÔ∏è My learnings from this project:
  - Learnet about JavaScript ```debounce`` fuction
    - The overhead of a function can be reduced by preventing it from being called repeatedly. This will help to speed up the website.
  
  Sample Code:
  ```
      function debounce(func, wait = 20, immediate = true) {
      var timeout;
      return function() {
        var context = this, args = arguments;
        var later = function() {
          timeout = null;
          if (!immediate) func.apply(context, args);
        };
        var callNow = immediate && !timeout;
        clearTimeout(timeout);
        timeout = setTimeout(later, wait);
        if (callNow) func.apply(context, args);
      };
    };
  ```
    
    
  
  # JavaScript 30-Day 14 
  ## JavaScript References VS Copying

  ## LocalStorage
  - Today's Challenge is about 2 main things:
         1.Local Storage
         2.Event Deligation

   ### ‚úçÔ∏èMy learnings from this project: 
   - ```e.preventDefault()``` -> stops the page from reloading.
   - ```JSON.stringify(items)``` -> When you pass items it's going to convert your objects and arrays into a JSON string.
   - ```JSON.parse()``` -> take items from the string and put it back into form whatever it was initially.
   - ```If you addEventListner()``` on something that doesn't exist, you'll know that in future it won't be clicked.
  
  # JavaScript 30-Day 16

  # JavaScript 30-Day 25 
  ## Event Capture, Propagation, Bubbling, and Once
  ### ‚úçÔ∏èMy learnings from this project:
  - Learnet about ```propagation```, ```bubbling```, ```event capturing```, and new property ```once```.
    - Bubbling refers to the browser being able to determine what you clicked on, as well as trigger clicks to ripple up every time you click. For example:
Whenever you click on a nested element, it actually starts from the top and then captures all of those events. It then starts at the bottom and starts doing something called a bubble.
    - The capture happens from top to bottom and then the events, the events haven't started yet. It only captures where you clicked, and is storing them. As you go up, it will begin to bubble up, which means it will start triggering events as you go up.
  
  - ```e.stopPropagation();```-> *stop bubbling this event up*
  
- If you set once to true it will listen for a click and unbind itself and unbinding itself is the same thing as ```div.removeEvent.Listener('click', logText)```
- You can use it for buttons when someone clicks that button more than once. (Example: Store checkouts)
``` 
  button.addEventListner('click', () =>{
   console.log('click!!!');
 },{
  once: true
});
  ```
